title: Web Dashboard
description: The opencodex GUI for proxy health, providers, models, delegation guidance, auth pools, usage, and logs.
---

opencodex ships a local web dashboard (a Vite/React app under `gui/`) served from the proxy. It is the
shortest path to managing providers, Codex/ChatGPT accounts, catalog models, sidecars, sub-agent
settings, and request traffic.

## Opening it

```bash
ocx gui
```

This opens `http://localhost:<port>` in your browser, auto-starting the proxy first if needed. In
development you can run the GUI dev server separately against a running proxy:

```bash
ocx start
bun run dev:gui
```

## What you can do

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard summary** | Multi-agent mode, online state, version, uptime, provider count, 30-day token total, active providers, and available native/routed models. |
| **Sub-agent delegation** | Choose a native or routed guidance model and an optional reasoning effort for v1 delegation prompts. This is not a per-spawn router; see below. |
| **Sidecars** | Choose the web-search model and effort plus the vision-description model. Changes apply on the next request. |
| **Maintenance** | Resync the Codex model catalog, inspect project-local config bypass warnings, check the latest or preview release, and run an update with optional proxy restart. |
| **Startup safety** | Show whether injected Codex routing survives a restart, with separate service and launcher-shim health plus exact repair commands. |
| **Windows tray** | Install a per-user login tray for one-click proxy start, stop, restart, dashboard access, and status. The tray is a controller, not a proxy restart service. |
| **Codex autostart** | Allow an already-installed Codex launcher shim to run `ocx ensure`. This toggle does not install a shim or background service. |
| **Providers** | Add, edit, enable/disable, and remove providers; manage OAuth account pools and API-key pools where supported. Provider Settings can disable live model discovery for endpoints with missing, slow, or oversized `/models` catalogs. |
| **Add provider** | Search registry-backed presets for account login, API-key services, local servers, or a custom endpoint. |
| **Codex Auth** | Add ChatGPT/Codex pool accounts, select the next-session account, refresh 5h / weekly / 30d quotas, enable or disable quota auto-switch, set its 1–100% threshold, and configure transient-failure failover. |
| **Subagents** | Feature up to five bare native or namespaced routed models in the `spawn_agent` override list. |
| **Models** | Toggle native GPT and routed models, set provider allowlists and context caps, choose v1/base/v2, and configure the v2 thread limit. Configured providers stay visible as zero-model groups when discovery is off or returns no rows. |
| **Logs** | Auto-refresh recent requests with tokens, requested effort and (when available) effective outbound effort, resolved model, provider, status, request id, duration, and error details. The detail view includes the exact reasoning wire field when the adapter emits one. Filter by opaque conversation/session id (when the client sends one) to total tokens and estimated list-price cost for the currently loaded Logs ring. |
| **Usage / Debug** | Inspect token-usage coverage and trends, or enable opt-in provider transport and usage-extraction diagnostics. |
| **Storage** | Read-only CODEX_HOME disk breakdown (sessions, archives, DBs, attachments). Optional archived cleanup: preview the oldest N%, then quarantine to `CODEX_HOME/.trash` (default) or permanently delete behind an explicit checkbox. Active sessions stay read-only. Cleanup is refused while Codex holds the newest/active `state_*.sqlite` locked. Quarantined files are **not** restorable from the dashboard — recover manually from `.trash/<epoch>/` using `manifest.json` if needed. |
| **Stop** | Gracefully stop the proxy and installed background service, restore native Codex, and exit (`POST /api/stop`). |

### Linking to a section

There is a single layout, so there is no layout switch to configure. Dashboard sections are
addressable instead: `#dashboard` opens Overview, and `#dashboard/providers` and
`#dashboard/models` open the other two. Reload, bookmark, and Back all keep the section you were
on. **Logs** works the same way with `#logs` and `#logs/debug`. An older `#providers/workspace`
bookmark now lands on `#providers`.

Cost values in **Logs** and **Usage** are API list-price equivalents calculated from reported tokens.
They are not billing receipts or evidence of an actual charge; subscription usage or provider credits
may apply instead.

## Model visibility

The **Models** switches show final Codex visibility: a routed model is on only when its provider allowlist includes it (or no allowlist is set) and it is not disabled. Turning a model on reconciles both filters atomically; **All on** clears the provider allowlist so newly discovered models are also on.

## Delegation picker vs spawn routing

The Dashboard's **Sub-agent delegation** picker stores `injectionModel` and, optionally,
`injectionEffort`. On a v1 turn, opencodex injects guidance telling the parent agent which exact
model and reasoning effort to pass to `spawn_agent`. Choosing a model enables that guidance at any
parent reasoning effort; clearing the model also clears the stored effort.

:::caution
This picker is delegation guidance for the v1 compatibility surface. On `multi_agent_v2`, the
current proxy does not append the v1 injection message, and every spawned sub-agent inherits the
parent session's model. It is not a proxy-side cross-model router. See
[Sub-agent Surface](/guides/sub-agent-surface/) for the canonical v1/base/v2 behavior.
:::

The picker offers enabled native and routed models plus the global Codex effort ladder. The API
validates the selected effort globally; Codex still validates a spawn effort against the target
catalog entry.

## Codex Auth and account pools

The **Codex Auth** page manages the native ChatGPT/Codex route:

- Manually choosing an account changes the next new Codex session; an already-bound thread keeps its
  current account for that manual switch.
- Thread affinity prevents per-request flapping. With quota auto-switch enabled, a long-running
  thread is periodically re-evaluated and may rebind after its relevant usage reaches the threshold
  and a strictly lower-usage eligible account exists.
- New sessions can choose the lowest-usage eligible account. Paid plans score the hottest known 5h,
  weekly, or 30d window; Go/Free plans use the 30d window only.
- When WHAM supplies `limit_window_seconds`, Codex Auth classifies a primary window of at least 28
  days as 30d instead of assuming every primary window is weekly. Responses without a duration keep
  the legacy weekly interpretation.
- **Refresh quotas** re-reads account usage immediately so routing and the account cards use the same
  values.
- Pool request logs use opaque labels such as `p3fa91c`, never account emails.

### Quota recovery

Codex Auth warns before an account runs out instead of letting work stop mid-session. Each account
carries one quota-health state derived from its most restrictive known window (5h, weekly, 30d, or a
provider-reported custom window):

| Usage of the controlling window | State | What the dashboard does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| below 70% | healthy | nothing |
| 70–79% | warning | shows a status notice with the window, usage, and reset time |
| 80–94% | critical | recommends switching to another account |
| 95–99% | critical (urgent) | raises the notice to an alert |
| 100%, or a hard quota response | exhausted | opens the recovery picker |

Quota data that is missing or too old is reported as unknown, and the notice asks for a refresh
rather than guessing the remaining quota.

The recovery picker lists the Codex accounts you have already signed in to, with masked email, plan,
usage, reset time, and a short explanation. Accounts that need reauthentication, have no stored
credential, or are themselves exhausted cannot be selected. Selecting an account refreshes stale
quota first, then routes new work to it; existing threads keep their original account, so the picker
describes this as continuing in a new session. If no account is usable, the notice shows the reset
time and offers to sign in to another account through the normal Codex login flow.

This is a recovery aid for accounts you already own. It does not raise provider limits, and it never
creates or automates accounts.

:::tip
Adding **Ollama Cloud** or another catalog provider from the dashboard copies its text-versus-vision
classification into the saved provider config, so the [vision sidecar](/guides/sidecars/)
is gated correctly without manual classification.
